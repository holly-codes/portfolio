# Portfolio

This is the GitHub repo for my portfolio site, hosted on holly-codes.com.

# Technologies

Currently using:

- HTML5
- Flexbox
- CSS3
- NextJS

# Design

Homepage inspired by a design I saw on Dribbble, [found here](https://dribbble.com/shots/6130245-LW-3D-Motion-Hero-Banner). Otherwise, I took inspiration from the aesthetic to make it my own.

# Revisions

_v. 1.0 (live)_

-   Initial version of the site, including all of the site sections

_v. 1.1 (in development)_

-   Add capability to more modularize the portfolio and resume sections by utilizing a headless CMS integration like Contentful to dynamically obtain the content for these sections
-   Update fonts to be more polished and professional-looking
-   Refactor to add React Helmet to dynamically generate the `<head>`
-   Refactor to add a layout that renders child elements on each page instead of rendering the same components over and over again on different pages
-   Better use of Flexbox and CSS Grid instead of margins and padding

# Future State

I want to add a few things to this site before really launching it, including:

- Dynamic PDF generation of my resume page, rather than a PDF uploaded to the public directory
- Contact form that submits to my email, instead of requiring you to email me with a `mailto:` link
