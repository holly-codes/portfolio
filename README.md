# Portfolio
This is the GitHub repo for my portfolio site, hosted on holly-codes.com.

# Technologies
Currently using:
* HTML
* Flexbox
* CSS3
* NextJS

# Design
Homepage inspired by a design I saw on Dribbble, [found here](https://dribbble.com/shots/6130245-LW-3D-Motion-Hero-Banner). Otherwise, I took inspiration from the aesthetic to make it my own.

# In Progress
* More pages. The routing is there, but the content is not.
* More styling. I want to change out the header fonts so that it doesn't all look so bland.
* Fixing the styling I _do_ have - some of it is kinda busted. (Okay, it's really busted. It's in progress, I'm fixing it.)

# Future State
I want to add a few things to this site before really launching it, including:
* Dynamic PDF generation of my resume page
* Contact form that submits to my email, instead of requiring you to email me
* Links to GitHub, Codepen, etc. in the footer
* Copyright statement also in the footer
