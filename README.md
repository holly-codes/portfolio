# Portfolio

This is the GitHub repo for my portfolio site, hosted on holly-codes.com. This branch in particular is an in-progress redesign.

# Technologies

Currently using:

- HTML
- Flexbox
- CSS3
- NextJS

# Design

The current live site was inspired by a design on Dribbble, but the new one is all me and my mediocre design skills, designed on the fly.

# In Progress

- The redesign!

# Future State

I want to add a few things! Just a few.

- Dynamic PDF generation of my resume page
- Componentization of the head by adding React Helmet
- Contact form that submits to my email, instead of requiring you to email me
- Cooler components - I want to add things like a horizontal accordion showing you project stats of each project in my portfolio (or possibly one segment per project), a nifty hero, redo my navigation, and make my footer look prettier
