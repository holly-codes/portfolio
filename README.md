# Portfolio

This is the GitHub repo for my portfolio site, hosted on holly-codes.com. This branch in particular is an in-progress redesign.

# Technologies

Currently using:

- HTML
- Flexbox
- CSS3
- NextJS

# Design

The current live site was inspired by a design on Dribbble, but the new one is all me and my mediocre design skills, designed on the fly.

# In Progress

The redesign! This includes changing up the aesthetic to make it more what I like, as well as refactoring to utilize SCSS and make better use of Flexbox. Potentially, even change Flexbox out for Grid - unsure as of yet.

I'll also be redoing my resume to make it .... well, a little more fun. It's quite dry right now, to say the least.

# Future State

I want to add a few things! Just a few.

- Dynamic PDF generation of my resume page
- Componentization of the head by adding React Helmet
- Contact form that submits to my email, instead of requiring you to email me
- Cooler components - I want to add things like a horizontal accordion showing you project stats of each project in my portfolio (or possibly one segment per project), a nifty hero, redo my navigation, and make my footer look prettier
