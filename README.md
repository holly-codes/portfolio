# Portfolio

This is the GitHub repo for my portfolio site, hosted on holly-codes.com.

# Technologies

Currently using:

- HTML
- Flexbox
- CSS3
- NextJS

# Design

Homepage inspired by a design I saw on Dribbble, [found here](https://dribbble.com/shots/6130245-LW-3D-Motion-Hero-Banner). Otherwise, I took inspiration from the aesthetic to make it my own.

# In Progress

- More pages. The routing is there, but the content is not.
- Mobile navigation

# Future State

I want to add a few things to this site before really launching it, including:

- Dynamic PDF generation of my resume page
- Contact form that submits to my email, instead of requiring you to email me
- Links to GitHub, Codepen, etc. in the footer
- Copyright statement also in the footer

I want to do some refactors to make this better, including:

- More componentization. Currently, the site is mainly vanilla HTML and I'd like to fix that and really use the power of NextJS and ReactJS.
- Better use of Flexbox and CSS Grid instead of margins and padding.
